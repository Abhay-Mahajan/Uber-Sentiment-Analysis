Text and Sentiment analysis for the uber ride reviews using python and machine learning

• Web scraped the Uber reviews to a CSV file using python, performed text mining classification on the data. 
• Converted “Words” to “Numbers” using the NLP Bag of Words model and then implemented TFIDF. 
• Trained few supervised learning models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression). Evaluated the models using Accuracy and AUC-ROC and chose the best model. 
**• Deployed the final model using Flask a micro web framework in python.**

It predicts sentiment of the new text reviews input as “Positive” (1) OR “Negative” (0)
